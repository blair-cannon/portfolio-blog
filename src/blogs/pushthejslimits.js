        <p className="blog-text">
        I had a huge AHA moment this week around my developmental process. A part of the curriculum 
        is that our instructors will hold a code-along session where we can watch them code something
         around the topics that we are learning that week. I have been copying down their code as example
        code to have to work with and figure out for later hoping that it would make my project more
        successful in the end. Instead, what I realized was happening with this method, is that I was
        always too busy keeping up with the speed of a high-level developer to ever gain any of the 
        knowledge that is so valuable during these sessions. The opportunity to watch my instructors
        talk through their thinking process, see how they format or order their code, and most importantly
        to see how they encounter errors and use different processes for solving such errors is priceless.
        I now know that improving my overall developer skills should always going to be the goal.

        <li className="blog-question">
        What does it mean to develop good code? 
        </li>
        <p className="blog-text" >
        I used to think that good code was simply working, organized code.
         I have since learned that it is also important to have code that is
        stable and easy to maintain. A company is always going to be updating
        and making changes to their websites and applications and the easier
        it is for me to do so is going to make the biggest difference.

        <li className="blog-question">
            What does it mean to be a good developer?
        </li>
        <p className="blog-text" >
        I think that being a good developer means that you have a can-do personality
         and even if you are asked to do something that you donâ€™t yet understand, 
         you are confident that you can research, learn, and apply the information
        to give the client what the want. Thus, accompanying the can-do personality,
        I think a good developer has creativity, persistence, a big-picture focus,
        and a desire to always be learning.

        <li className="blog-question">
            What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
        </li>
        <p className="blog-text" >
            Developers hate working with messy code. Our instructors
            have been engraining that in our heads daily. Even though
            right now no one is collaborating on our code, the habit
            to write code that is easy to read is going to be essential
            when we have teams of being working together.
