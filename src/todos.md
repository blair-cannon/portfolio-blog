to do: 
- fix on hover of nav links so they don't move
- svg links working?
- make hover of nav links like the restaurant hover
- animations
- blog links
- footer 
- arrows next to read more


from jac
- box around the picture
- maybe rounded edges on pic
- nav hover: only on the bottom
- padding within icons
- group of name and subhead
- call to action button or icon to create movement 
- make icon rounded, not in a box
- maybe icons are the dark green
- don't block in the above the fold, so that you know to scroll
